# linphone-swift-demo

[linephone](https://www.linphone.org/) is a open source VOIP project.In this repository, we emonstrate how to integrate [liblinphone](http://www.linphone.org/technical-corner/liblinphone/overview) into a swift project. We includes 3 common scenarios: 

- make a phone call
- auto pick an incoming phone call
- registration and idle 

## Usage

1. Remember to modify Secret.plist to your account

2. Modify demo() in LinphoneManager.swift to test different scenario like call out or pick an incoming call.

3. After launch app, look your text console to get the linphone output details.
